# E-commerce Platform

I'm excited to share one of the key projects I built during my journey in the Front-end Web Development Bootcamp at Sprints. This Comprehensive E-commerce platform was a fantastic opportunity to put my skills into practice and push my understanding of modern front-end technologies to the next level!

💻 Tech Stack:
⚡ Vite for lightning-fast development
⚛️ ReactJS for building dynamic UI components
🛠️ Redux Toolkit for state management
📋 Formik & Yup for smooth form handling and validation
🎨 TailwindCSS for sleek, responsive styling
🌐 API integration with fakestoreapi.com for fetching products and orders
🛒 localStorage to persist shopping cart, new products, and order data

🌟 Key Features:
- Home Page: Displays products in a user-friendly grid view with filtering, sorting, the ability to add new products in a Modal and the ability to edit or delete new products (CRUD operations).

- Cart Page: Manage shopping cart items, adjust quantities, and review a detailed checkout summary.

- Checkout Page: Multistep checkout forms for a smooth and secure shopping experience.

- Order History: A dedicated page where users can view their past orders.

This project was a significant milestone in improving my front-end development skills!
